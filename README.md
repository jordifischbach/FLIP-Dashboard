What is FLIP? 

Successful climate change, while a global challenge, will require local solutions to be successful. Historically, climate action has been framed as an expensive distraction from more immediate local goals such as economic development and social prosperity. "FLIP", the Free, Local, Immediate, and Persuasive Co-Benefits of Climate Action seeks to reframe this faulty narrative by demonstrating the economic, environmental, social, and health co-benefits climate action accrues to the local population, while simultaniously decreasing GHG emissions.

About the Dashboard: 
1) Interactive world map displays FLIP case study locations with color-coded markers representing different sectors.
2) Stacked area plot displaying and comparing countries' sector specific CO2e emissions from 1990 to 2021.

DATA: 
Case studies geolocated data generated by research team.
GHG by sector by country. Data displays countries' sector specific CO2e emissions for  from 1990 to 2021.
